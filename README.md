This is a Project I created using the IGDB Game API. The project was built using React and the backend proxy was implemented using NodeJS to avoid any CORS issues when running locally.

Steps to Setup Locally
1) Simply Clone the current repo using _git clone_
2) Do an _npm init_ to setup neccessary packages
3) Run _npm run dev_ on a terminal
4) Should see app running on whatever port Vite specifies. Default is 5173 if it is not being used
