This is a Project I created using the IGDB Game API. The project was built using React and the backend proxy was implemented using NodeJS to avoid any CORS issues when running locally.

Steps to Setup Locally

a) Front-End
   1) Simple Clone the current repo using _git clone_
   2) Do an _npm init_ to setup neccessary packages
   3) Run _npm run dev_ on a terminal
   4) Should see app running on whatever port Vite specifies. Default is 5173 if it is not being used

b) BackEnd
   1) To avoid running into CORS issues
   2) Also includes all routes database configurations
   3) Go to the following repo: https://github.com/syedwajihrizvi/GameCom-BackEnd
   4) Clone the repo using _git clone_
   5) Do an _npm init_ to install all the packages
   6) Run _node server.js_ on a separate terminal from the front end
